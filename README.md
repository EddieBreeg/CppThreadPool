# CppThreadPool

A simple thread pool class for C++

## Why?

I wanted to implement a generic thread pool system, out of curiosity, nothing more to it.
If you really want something reliable and performant, I'm afraid this probably won't
be what you're looking for.

## How?

Just add [ThreadPool.hpp](ThreadPool.hpp) to your project and voil√†.
The header is self documented, you should have everything you need right in the comments.
